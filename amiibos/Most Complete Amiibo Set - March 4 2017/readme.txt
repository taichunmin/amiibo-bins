Thanks to all of you, you're all awesome. Warm Regards from #N2Elite on EfNet. <3
Thanks for helping preserve this important part of Nintendo History. (:

Mario Sports Superstars - Series 1 Cards [Future Release]
---------------------------------------------------------
[90 Cards]
[Release Window: May 2017]
A series of Mario themed cards for the Upcoming Mario Sports titles are releasing. Christ, I'm afraid this will be the hardest series of amiibo by far to get dumps of. '_>'
 
Fire Emblem - Wave 1 [Future Release]
-------------------------------------
[2 Figures: Alm & Celica]
[Release Window: May 2017]
Fire Emblem is getting a new game in May called Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia, and alongside it comes two amiibo. The two apparently come together in one box, so that's good.
 
Super Smash Bros. - Wave 10 [Future Release]
--------------------------------------------
[3 Figures: Bayonetta, Corrin, Cloud]
[Release Window: 2017]
The status of these figures are unknown to the public officially. It was said they were in production during what was the last Smash Direct, but there has since been no info from nintendo. Rumor has it that they will be delayed and release with a version of Super Smash Bros. for the upcoming Nintendo Switch console. It's been confirmed unequivocally they are coming, as data exists in the recent Yoshi game for handling Corrins amiibo, found via data mining, we just don't know when.
